1. Static Testing vs Dynamic Testing
	+ Static testing check the test object itself "in itself"
	  -Artefacts of the development process, e.g. informal texts, models, formal texts
	   ,program code
	   
	   
    + Dynamic testing check running software
	+ So the test object will be executed on a processor in a dynamic testing
		- Providing of input values
		- Observing the results
		

2. a. Dynamic testing
	+ Testing that involves the execution of the software of the component or system
	
   b. Test basis
	+ All documents from which the requirements of a component or system can be
	  inferred. The documentation on which test cases are based.
	  
   c. Test condition
    + An item or event e.g., a function, transaction, feature, quality attribute or 
	  structural element of a component or system that could be verfied by one or
	  more test cases.
	  
	  
   d. Test design specification
	+ making changes of shit
